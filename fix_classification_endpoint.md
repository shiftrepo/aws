# Fix for `/analyze_classification` Endpoint

## Problem Identification

When attempting to call the `/analyze_classification` endpoint:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5006/analyze_classification \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "classification_code": "G",
    "start_year": 2010,
    "end_year": 2023
  }'
```

The system was returning a 404 "Not Found" error, indicating that the endpoint wasn't properly registered or the service wasn't running correctly.

## Root Cause Analysis

After examining the trend-analysis service code in `AI_integrated_search_mcp/app/trend-analysis/app.py`:

1. The `/analyze_classification` endpoint was correctly defined in the codebase
2. However, the endpoint wasn't appearing in the FastAPI OpenAPI documentation (`/openapi.json`)
3. The trend-analysis-service container wasn't running properly on port 5006

## Solution

We've developed a specialized Classification Analysis API that connects directly to the database service:

1. **API Server Implementation** (`classification_api_server.py`):
   - FastAPI-based server with proper endpoint registration
   - Direct database connection for querying patent classification data
   - Advanced analysis and assessment capabilities
   - Properly structured JSON response format

2. **Containerization** (`Dockerfile.classification_api`):
   - Python 3.9 base image
   - Required dependencies installation
   - Proper port exposure (5006)
   - Network connectivity to the database service

3. **Deployment** (`run_classification_api.sh`):
   - Container network configuration for database communication
   - Clean start and restart capabilities
   - Proper environment variable configuration

## Implementation Details

The API uses a direct SQL query to extract classification data:

```sql
SELECT 
    substr(filing_date, 1, 4) as year,
    assignee_original as applicant_name,
    COUNT(*) as application_count
FROM 
    publications
WHERE 
    substr(ipc_code, 1, 1) = '{classification_code}'
    AND substr(filing_date, 1, 4) >= '{start_year}'
    AND substr(filing_date, 1, 4) <= '{end_year}'
GROUP BY 
    substr(filing_date, 1, 4), 
    assignee_original
ORDER BY 
    substr(filing_date, 1, 4), 
    COUNT(*) DESC
```

The API then processes this data to:
1. Group patent applications by year and applicant
2. Calculate yearly totals and trends
3. Identify top applicants in the classification field
4. Generate comprehensive assessments of market dynamics
5. Analyze recent activity trends

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy the API service:

1. Make the deployment script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x run_classification_api.sh
   ```

2. Run the deployment script:
   ```bash
   ./run_classification_api.sh
   ```

3. Test the API:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5006/analyze_classification \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "classification_code": "G",
       "start_year": 2010,
       "end_year": 2023
     }'
   ```

## Response Structure

The API returns a structured JSON response with:

1. `classification_code`: The requested classification
2. `yearly_applicant_counts`: Object with yearly data, containing top applicants and their patent counts
3. `assessment`: Detailed analysis of trends, top applicants, and market dynamics

## Technical Architecture

The implementation follows a three-tier architecture:
1. **API Layer**: FastAPI-based HTTP API server
2. **Data Access Layer**: SQL queries to the database service
3. **Analysis Layer**: Processing and assessment logic

This decoupled approach ensures:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Easy maintenance and updates
- Clear API contract for clients
