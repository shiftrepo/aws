# Docker Testing Guide

## Daily Testing Schedule

As a team member working on the GitPlayground project, you should perform the following testing procedures every day:

### Morning Testing Routine (Before Starting Work)

1. **Start fresh containers**:
   ```bash
   ./test-docker.sh cleanup
   ./test-docker.sh start
   ```

2. **Verify functionality**:
   ```bash
   ./test-docker.sh status
   ./test-docker.sh test
   ```

3. **Generate a status report for the daily meeting**:
   ```bash
   ./test-docker.sh report
   ```

### End of Day Testing

1. **Test your day's work**:
   ```bash
   ./test-docker.sh restart
   ./test-docker.sh test
   ```

2. **Capture screenshots for documentation**:
   ```bash
   ./test-docker.sh screenshot
   # Or use your browser to take screenshots manually
   ```

3. **Update GitHub issue #48**:
   - Use the report generated by `./test-docker.sh report`
   - Add screenshots showing your progress
   - Document any issues or blockers

## Dealing with Common Issues

### Container Won't Start

If the container fails to start properly:

1. Check logs:
   ```bash
   ./test-docker.sh logs
   ```

2. Try a complete cleanup:
   ```bash
   ./test-docker.sh cleanup
   podman system prune -a --volumes
   ./test-docker.sh start
   ```

3. Check for port conflicts:
   ```bash
   lsof -i :3000
   ```

### Application Isn't Accessible

If the container starts but the application isn't accessible:

1. Check container health:
   ```bash
   podman inspect --format='{{.State.Health.Status}}' git-playground
   ```

2. Check application logs:
   ```bash
   ./test-docker.sh logs | grep -i error
   ```

3. Try accessing with curl:
   ```bash
   curl -v http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Reporting Issues

When reporting issues in GitHub issue #48:

1. **Be specific**: Include exact error messages and screenshots
2. **Include environment details**: Add container status and health check information
3. **Document reproduction steps**: List precise steps to reproduce the issue
4. **Suggest possible solutions**: If you have ideas on what might fix the issue

## GitHub Issue #48 Progress Reporting Format

Use this format for your daily updates:

```markdown
## Daily Progress Report - [Date]

### Completed Tasks
- [List completed tasks]

### Current Work
- [What you're working on now]

### Next Tasks
- [What you plan to work on next]

### Issues/Blockers
- [Any issues blocking progress]

### Testing Results
[Paste output from ./test-docker.sh report]

### Screenshots
[Add screenshots of your work]
```

## Testing Schedule

1. **Monday-Friday**: Run full test suite at start and end of day
2. **Before Pull Requests**: Comprehensive testing with detailed reports
3. **After Major Changes**: Always test and document results

Remember to communicate any persistent issues immediately to the team rather than struggling with them alone.
