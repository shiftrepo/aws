## Requirement 1: Authentication System

### Feature 1.1: User Registration

**Description**: Allow new users to create accounts with email and password.

**User Story**: As a new user, I want to register for an account so that I can access the scheduling system.

**Implementation Details**:
- Email-based registration with validation
- Password strength requirements (min 8 chars, uppercase, lowercase, number, special char)
- Email verification (optional Phase 2)
- Unique email constraint in database
- bcrypt password hashing (12 rounds)

**API Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/auth/register`

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "SecurePass123!",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": "uuid",
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Doe",
      "role": "MEMBER"
    },
    "accessToken": "jwt-token",
    "refreshToken": "refresh-token"
  }
}
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ User can register with valid email and password
- ‚úÖ System rejects duplicate emails with clear error message
- ‚úÖ System rejects weak passwords with specific requirements
- ‚úÖ Password is hashed and never stored in plain text

- JWT refresh token (7 days expiration)
- Rate limiting (5 attempts per 15 minutes)

**API Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/auth/login`

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "SecurePass123!"
