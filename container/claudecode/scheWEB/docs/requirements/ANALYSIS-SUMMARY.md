## 🎯 PROJECT SUMMARY

### What We're Building
A **team availability coordination system** that allows up to 30 users to:
- Register with their default working hours
- Input their weekly availability using an intuitive drag-and-drop interface
- View which time slots have common availability across team members
- Coordinate meeting times efficiently

### Key Characteristics
- **Internal tool**: For team use only, not public-facing
- **Simple & friendly**: Easy to use, visually appealing
- **Lightweight**: SQLite database, minimal infrastructure
- **Quick deployment**: docker-compose single-command setup

## 📞 STAKEHOLDER QUESTIONS TO RESOLVE

1. **Timezone Handling**: Confirm all users are in the same timezone?
2. **Meeting Creation**: Is this system only for availability, or should it create actual meeting invitations?
3. **Historical Data**: Should we keep old availability data, or only current week?
4. **Notifications**: Are email/Slack notifications needed for when common slots are found?
5. **Access Control**: Do all users have equal permissions, or are there admin roles?
6. **Mobile Priority**: Is tablet support sufficient, or do we need phone optimization too?
7. **Data Export**: Should users be able to export availability to CSV/iCal?
8. **Recurring Patterns**: Should the system support "every Monday at 2pm" type patterns?
