## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Browser compatibility**: Test early and often
- **API changes**: Version API and maintain backwards compatibility
- **Performance**: Monitor bundle size throughout development
- **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated, use Dependabot

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope creep**: Stick to MVP, defer nice-to-haves
- **Technical debt**: Allocate time for refactoring
- **Testing delays**: Write tests alongside features
- **Integration issues**: Start API integration early

## Team Coordination
