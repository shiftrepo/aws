# FastAPI Middleware Import Fix

## Issue Description

The patentDWH MCP enhanced service is encountering a startup error with the following traceback:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/app/server_with_enhanced_nl.py", line 20, in <module>
    from fastapi.middleware.base import BaseHTTPMiddleware
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi.middleware.base'
```

This error occurs because in newer versions of FastAPI, the `BaseHTTPMiddleware` class has been relocated from the `fastapi.middleware.base` module to `starlette.middleware.base`.

## Root Cause

FastAPI's architecture relies heavily on Starlette, and in recent versions, FastAPI made structural changes that moved some middleware functionality directly to Starlette components. The `BaseHTTPMiddleware` class is now imported directly from Starlette rather than being re-exported through FastAPI.

## Fix Implementation

The fix includes:

1. Updating import statements to use the correct module path in:
   - `patentDWH/app/server_with_enhanced_nl.py`
   - Any other server files that might use this import

2. Ensuring `starlette` is explicitly included in the requirements file:
   - Added `starlette>=0.27.0` to `patentDWH/app/requirements_enhanced.txt`

3. Creating a dedicated fix script (`fix_fastapi_middleware_import.sh`) that:
   - Updates import statements in server files
   - Adds the starlette dependency if not present
   - Creates backups of modified files

## How to Apply the Fix

1. Execute the fix script:
   ```bash
   cd patentDWH
   ./fix_fastapi_middleware_import.sh
   ```

2. Rebuild and restart the patentDWH MCP enhanced container:
   ```bash
   # Stop existing services
   ./stop_all_services.sh
   
   # Start with fixed configuration
   ./start_all_services.sh
   ```

## Integration with Comprehensive Fixes

This fix has been integrated into the `fix_all_mcp_issues.sh` script to ensure all patentDWH MCP services start correctly. The comprehensive fix script addresses multiple issues including:

1. Network connectivity between containers
2. FastAPI middleware import issues (this fix)
3. LangChain compatibility issues
4. AWS credential configuration
5. Circular import issues

Running the comprehensive fix script will apply all necessary fixes to ensure proper service operation.

## Additional Notes

- If you're developing custom middleware using FastAPI, make sure to use the correct import path for `BaseHTTPMiddleware`.
- This is a common issue when upgrading FastAPI from older versions (pre-0.95.0) to newer versions.
